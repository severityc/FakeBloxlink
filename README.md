# ⚙️ Setup

1. Create a Discord bot at https://www.discord.com/developers
2. In the developer portal, make sure that all **Privledged Gateway Intents** are enabled
3. Copy the bot token and put it where it says `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` via [main.py](https://github.com/Severitylol/FakeBloxlink/blob/main/main.py)
4. Edit the Settings in the code and run the bot
5. Add the bot to your server by making a **OAuth2 Url Generator** (Make sure it has administrator permissions)
6. Now make a verify channel which tells other users to use the `!verify` command in any channel and it will send them a dm with your Bloxlink "verification link"

# ⬇️ Installation
Type ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the directory of the folder or in the terminal/shell

# ⭐ Features

- **Direct Message** embed "verification" command: `!verify`

# ⚠️ Disclaimer
This code is meant to be used for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for what other people decide to do with the code. I will not be helping others in setting this up because it is so simple, but I will be updating the code as the api becomes deprecated over time.
